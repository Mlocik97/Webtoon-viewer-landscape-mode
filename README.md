# Webtoon-viewer-landscape-mode

The browser extension that allows you to rotate viewer, so it's readable on desktop devices if episode was prepared for landscape.

For example [SOULWINDER  Ep. 39 - Forebode](https://www.webtoons.com/en/thriller/soulwinder/ep-39-forebode/viewer?title_no=2880&episode_no=39)
has text rotated by 90Â° so it's not readable on desktop... we want to rotate viewer, so we reset rotated images the way, text is again readable...
